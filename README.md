This code functions as a **keylogger**, a program that records keystrokes made by a user on their keyboard. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Monitors Keyboard Activity**:
   - The code tracks every key that a user presses on the keyboard.

2. **Records Keystrokes**:
   - Each keystroke is recorded and saved into a file named `key_log.txt`.

3. **Handles Different Types of Keys**:
   - For regular characters (letters, numbers, symbols), it logs the exact character.
   - For special keys like space, enter, or function keys (e.g., `Shift`, `Ctrl`), it logs a representation of the key (e.g., `" "` for space or `"{key}"` for other special keys).

4. **Stops Logging on Escape Key**:
   - If the `Esc` key is pressed, the program stops recording keystrokes and exits.

Practical Use
- **Security Testing**: In ethical hacking, keyloggers are sometimes used to test how well a system or user can detect unauthorized monitoring.
- **Monitoring**: In some cases, keyloggers can be used for monitoring user activity on a system, though this must be done with clear legal and ethical considerations.

Output
- The recorded keystrokes are saved to `key_log.txt`, allowing you to review what was typed on the keyboard while the program was running.
